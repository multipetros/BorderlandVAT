## Introduction
In Greece, for islands of the prefectures of Lesvos, Chios, Samos, 
Dodecanese, Cyclade and for the islands Thasos, Samothrace, Northern 
Sporades and Skyros, apply a reduced VAT of 30%, rounded to the nearest unit.

A program that calculates the final price of products for these islands,
from pricelists issued for the rest of the greek territory is if anything useful.
